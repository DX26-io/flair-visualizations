# Introduction
Data Visualization can be understood as a graphical presentation of data to uncover the underlying information that it holds and allow the users to identify the patterns present in it. By delivering information in a vibrant and interactive structure it facilitates users to make quick decisions based upon their roles. What makes a data visualization even more powerful is its ability to process data in real time allowing immediacy in making a decision. On contrary to batch or event-driven visualization real-time analytics is the state of the art tool for any individual or organisation who must take tactical or operational decisions on the fly.

With support for more than 20 different basic and advanced visualizations, the users can view the data from various dimensions whether it be for distribution analytics, relationship analytics or comparison analytics. The Flair BI visualization library is completely open source, allowing any data enthusiasts to use it to create their own custom Business Intelligence tool or simply use the visualizations in their personal projects.
